My solutions to HackerRank's 10 Days Of Statistics

## Who are these solutions for?

I'm primarily publishing these for my own benefit. Completing this challenge has helped me develop a daily coding habit and solving coding problems that are beyond my comfort zone. Publishing my solutions here each day is a good way to view my progress, stay motivated, and also to consider documentation and refactoring knowing that the public and potential employers might be reading this.

Those of you who are maybe stuck and looking for guidance on a solution to your problem may also have stumbled upon this repository. Here you will find one solution to each problem. Please remember though, the point of this challenge is to improve your coding skills and understanding, not to earn a badge that might impress an employer - without the underlying knowledge you will be found out eventually! These solutions have some inline comments which help explain what decisions I'm making and why, so rather than copy-pasting the solutions and submitting, please read the comments to understand *why* the solution works too.

## About HackerRank's 10 Days Of Statistics

HackerRank's 10 Days of Statistics is a coding challenge where participants are given a coding problem to solve every day for 10 days. The problems start off relatively easy and gradually become more difficult as the challenge progresses.

Completing the 10 Days of Statistics challenge on HackerRank can be very beneficial for a number of reasons. First, it can help improve your coding skills by exposing you to a wide range of coding problems and techniques. You'll have the opportunity to practice different programming concepts and get a better understanding of how they work in practice.

Secondly, completing the 10 Days of Statistics challenge can also help you build up your coding portfolio. You can showcase your solutions to the coding problems you solved during the challenge to potential employers or collaborators, which can help you stand out from other candidates.

Finally, completing the challenge helps you develop a daily coding habit. By committing to solving a coding problem every day for 10 days, you'll be building a routine and making coding a part of your daily life. This can help you stay motivated and consistent in your coding practice, which can be very beneficial in the long run.

## Are these solutions correct? 

These solutions work and pass the acceptance criteria, but of course do not necessarily mean they are the most efficient or optimal solutions to each problem. I also welcome any constructive thoughts or guidance on how my solutions may be better optimised.
